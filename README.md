DESIGN OF A SOCIAL DISTANCING SENSOR
Sami MEZHOUD, Michel OSEE, Fran√ßois QUITIN
One of the major challenges of easing lockdowns will be to ensure social distancing in order to avoid new infection spikes. This is especially the case in industrial and office environments, where people may inadvertently get too close to one another. We are repurposing our ultra-wideband localization technology to create a social distancing sensor, which will emit a warning signal when people get within a certain distance of each other. The device will be portable, battery-powered, and provides an accuracy of less than 10 centimeters, thereby providing much more reliability than competing technologies.
